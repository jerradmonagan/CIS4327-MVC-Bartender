CIS 4327 â€“ IS Senior Project I
Model View Controller (MVC) Bartender Application
Due: August 31								        Individual Activity
The context  for this example is bar patrons ordering a cocktail via an online application and bartender preparing cocktails based on the order queue. In this application, bar patrons (customer users) can perform actions such as: view cocktail menu and place an order for a cocktail drink. Bartender (staff user) should be able to view cocktail order queue and set them for pick up by server after it is prepared.

To implement this online bartender application using MVC pattern, you will need a controller to handle cocktails order related actions (create, edit, and view). You will need a model for handling data and logic related to cocktail orders. You will need views for displaying cocktail menu and order queue.

The following provides an overview how the user request is handled:

1.	Index page that acts as a homepage for Bartender application from where patrons can access order option and from where bartenders can access order queue option.

2.	A controller that receives the user request as an HTTP GET or POST request.

3.	The controller examines user request and calls the model asking it to return the cocktails bar menu.

4.	The model is responsible for getting menu information from the database.

5.	The controller will use the appropriate view to display cocktail menu data to the user.

6.	The user reviews the menu and places an order for a cocktail drink.

7.	The controller examines user request and the parameters, and calls the model asking it to store cocktail order information in the database.

8.	When bartender chooses order queue option in the index page, the controller examines user request and calls the model asking it to return the list of cocktail orders.

9.	The model is responsible for getting cocktail order information from database.

10.	The controller will use the appropriate view to display cocktail orders to the user.

The purpose of this assignment is to help your team and mentor to assess each team member skills, strengths, and weakness. Also, the purpose of this assignment is to enforce each team member to start interacting with your mentor in an attempt to solve this problem. Mentors will use this assignment to determine your learning curve and kind of assistance you need to excel in the senior project class.
